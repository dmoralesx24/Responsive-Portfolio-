      <p>My name is David Morales I am currently 22 years old and I am real into fitness, music, and sports. I played ice hockey for my high school team and I loved it, you could say it definitely made my high school experience a lot better. Although I played a whole bunch of different sports like basketball, football, and baseball</p>

      <p>Some of my hobbies include playing sports with my friends, but also I enjoy going to the gym, fishing, hiking, video games, and coding.</p>

      <p>I'm currently a new programmer that is trying to change my career path so I can do something that I enjoy. Which is why I enrolled in University of Pennsylvania Coding Bootcamp so that I can sharpen my skills and further my education. I'm really looking forward to master this and to become as proficient as possible and land a great job.</p>

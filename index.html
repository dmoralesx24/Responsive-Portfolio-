      <p>My name is David Morales I am currently 22 years old and I am real into fitness and sports. I played ice hockey for my high school team and I loved it, you could say it definitely made my high school experience a lot better. Although I just love playing a whole bunch of different sports like basketball, football, baseball, and I even competed in boxing as a kid.</p>

      <p>Some of my hobbies include obviously the sports I play, but also I love fitness like going to the gym, fishing, and hiking.</p>

      <p>I'm currently trying to change my career path by learning how to code, which is why I enrolled in this bootcamp. I am going to work my butt off to try and learn this skill and to become proficient at it and hopefully land a great job.</p>
